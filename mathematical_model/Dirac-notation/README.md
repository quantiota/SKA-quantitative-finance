# Dirac Notation and the Density Operator in the SKA Framework

## Overview

This document defines the mathematical foundation of the Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA) framework using **Dirac notation**. It formalizes how the market state is represented as a quantum-inspired state vector, how regime probabilities and structural transitions are encoded in the **density operator**, and how this structure relates to entropy-based learning.

The goal is to provide a standalone mathematical reference that other SKA modules (e.g., real-time analytics, entropy flow, or QuestDB visualizations) can refer to.



## 1. Market State Vector

At any time $t$, the market is in a superposition of basis regimes:

$$
\Large{\lvert \Psi(t) \rangle = \Psi_0(t) \lvert 0 \rangle + \Psi_1(t) \lvert 1 \rangle + \Psi_2(t) \lvert 2 \rangle}
$$

* $\lvert 0 \rangle, \lvert 1 \rangle, \lvert 2 \rangle$: Basis vectors for Neutral, Bull, Bear
* $\Psi_i(t) = A_i(t) e^{iH_i(t)} \in \mathbb{C}$: Complex amplitude encoding probability and entropy

### Normalization:

$$
\large \langle \Psi(t) | \Psi(t) \rangle = |\Psi_0|^2 + |\Psi_1|^2 + |\Psi_2|^2 = 1
$$

## 2. Density Operator

The **density operator** is the outer product of the state vector with itself:

$$
\Large{\widehat{\rho}(t) = \lvert \Psi(t) \rangle \langle \Psi(t) \rvert}
$$

This object captures both **probabilities** and **structural relationships** (coherences) between regimes.

### Matrix Elements:

$$
\large \langle i \mid \widehat{\rho}(t) \mid j \rangle = \Psi_i^*(t) \Psi_j(t)
$$

This yields a 3x3 Hermitian matrix:

$$\widehat{\rho}(t) =
\begin{pmatrix}
|\Psi_0|^2 & \Psi_0^* \Psi_1 & \Psi_0^* \Psi_2 \\
\Psi_1^* \Psi_0 & |\Psi_1|^2 & \Psi_1^* \Psi_2 \\
\Psi_2^* \Psi_0 & \Psi_2^* \Psi_1 & |\Psi_2|^2
\end{pmatrix}$$




### Interpretation:

* **Diagonal terms**: $\rho_{ii} = |\Psi_i|^2$ = probability of being in regime $i$
* **Off-diagonal terms**: $\rho_{ij} = \Psi_i^* \Psi_j$ = coherence between regimes $i$ and $j$, interpreted as transition structure

## 3. Structural Transition Operator

A transition from regime $j \to i$ is represented by:

$$
\Large{\widehat{T}_{i \leftarrow j} = \lvert i \rangle \langle j \rvert}
$$

This operator transforms basis state $\lvert j \rangle$ into $\lvert i \rangle$.

### Expectation Value:

To extract the amplitude for a structural transition from $j \to i$:

$$
\large \langle \Psi \mid \widehat{T}_{i \leftarrow j} \mid \Psi \rangle = \Psi_i^*(t) \Psi_j(t)
$$

This equals the $(i,j)$ entry of the density matrix.

## 4. Entropy Interpretation

Each complex amplitude $\Psi_i(t)$ embeds an **entropy phase**:

$$
\Psi_i(t) = A_i(t) e^{i H_i(t)}
$$

This phase represents the **accumulated knowledge** or **informational weight** of being in regime $i$. Therefore, transitions (via $\Psi_i^* \Psi_j$) carry entropy shifts $H_j - H_i$.

## Author Note

This formalism supports a deeper view of the market as an **information-processing system**, not a sequence of discrete events. Transitions are not externally triggered but emerge from the **geometry of knowledge accumulation** encoded in the SKA state.
