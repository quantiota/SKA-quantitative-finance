# SKA-Based Probability Framework for Trading Bots

## 1. Introduction

This document presents a theoretical framework for modeling market-regime transitions using entropy-based probabilities (SKA) in a quantum-inspired notation. By employing Dirac (bra–ket) notation, we define market states in a concise and mathematically rigorous way. This README is intended for algorithmic trading developers who wish to integrate regime-switching probabilities into their trading bots.



## 2. Dirac Notation for Market Regimes

In our framework, we represent each market regime as a basis vector (ket) in an abstract state space:

* **Bull Market**:
  $\lvert\text{bull}\rangle$
* **Neutral Market**:
  $\lvert\text{neutral}\rangle$
* **Bear Market**:
  $\lvert\text{bear}\rangle$

These kets satisfy the orthonormality condition:

$$
\LARGE \langle i \vert j \rangle = \delta_{ij},
$$

where $i,j\in\{\text{bull},\text{neutral},\text{bear}\}$ and $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.

### 2.1 Completeness Relation

The basis spans the full regime space, so we have:

$$
\LARGE \mathbf{I} = \sum_{r\in\{\text{bull, neutral, bear}\}}\lvert r\rangle\langle r\rvert
$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity operator.


## 3. Time‐Domain Probability Normalization

Let \(T\) be the total length of our observation window. Define an operator \(\Delta\tau\) whose matrix elements

\[
\langle i \mid \Delta\tau \mid j\rangle \;=\;\Delta\tau_{ij}
\]

represent the total time spent transitioning from regime \(\lvert i\rangle\) to \(\lvert j\rangle\) during \(T\).  Then the **total statistical probability** satisfies

\[
\sum_{i,j}\frac{\langle i \mid \Delta\tau \mid j\rangle}{T} \;=\;1.
\]

We may therefore identify the empirical transition probability as

\[
P_{i\to j}
\;=\;
\frac{\langle i \mid \Delta\tau \mid j\rangle}{T},
\]

which guarantees \(\sum_{i,j}P_{i\to j}=1\) by construction.
