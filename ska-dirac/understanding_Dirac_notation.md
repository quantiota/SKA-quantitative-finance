##  Video Explanation: Understanding Bra–Ket Notation

[![Watch on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ctXDXABJRtg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctXDXABJRtg)

This video offers a clear introduction to **bra–ket notation** from quantum mechanics, explaining the meaning of `|ψ⟩`, ⟨φ|, and inner products like ⟨φ|ψ⟩. It’s particularly useful for understanding how we apply **Dirac notation** within the **Structured Knowledge Accumulation (SKA)** framework.

 *Recommended for readers unfamiliar with Hilbert space formalism or those looking for a concise visual refresher.*
